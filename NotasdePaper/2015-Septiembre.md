==========================================

We are moving away from the old view of frequency bands as behavioral or cognitive flags.


... only high-density recordings simultaneously performed at several depths can
correctly map for spatial variations in succesive waves originated by....

...while interpreting CSD maps is simple for voltage profiles
elicited by stimulating only one afferent pathway, their application to ongoing LFP renders
complex spatial maps of intermingled inward and outward current, and in general is not
feasible to identify the multiple  synaptic generators. Partial succes in SPW.

Checa que diablos es el Independent Component Analysis.

We found that CA3 assemblies are not rigid construcs, as the neurons that comprise them
may belong to differetn clusters and the do not always fire together...


The use of pathway-specific LFP eliminates important concern of an LFP oscillation
being a mixture of two or more inputs,...

CAP: Compound Action Potential
A complex CAP response is defined as one that contains several events
within the total response, all individal events being reproducible and
occurring at the same latency when evoked by an identical stymulis.

## Waveform similarity analysis

WSA is based on the cross correlation between two signals.
$$
xycorr(x, y, n) = \sum x*(m) u(n+m)
