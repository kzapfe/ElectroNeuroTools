For the bidimensional CSDA, we used a convex finite difference operator that
reduces the cross effect of the rectangular grid (citar Lindenberg 1990):

In order to reduce spatial noise we used a routine to check saturated or
otherwise failing electrodes and replaced their signal with the average
of its neighbors. Also, a Gaussian spatial routine was applied to reduce
the excessive contribution of rapidly varying edges. All the code is available
upon request.
