Current Source Density obtained through application of a numerical 2D Laplacian
operator, in various snapshots before, during and ending a first epileptic outburst.
The burst creates a pattern of discernible poles (sinks and sources) that
kindle the CA structure completely. The dynamical CSDA here proves its worth:
at similar violent activities, the LFP would cover all the details and we wouldn't
be able to discern the fine pattern structure which appears here. This is what gave
us the hint to separate the Sets of poles into their disjoint components.
The zero set, marked in the plots as white, can be used as border not only between
the Sink Set and the Source Set, but, adding our numerical error to it, to
separate each one of these sets into disjoint components.
