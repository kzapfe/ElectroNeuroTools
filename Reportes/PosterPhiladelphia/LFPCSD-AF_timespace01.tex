A space-time color map of the epileptic burst along the selected line A-F.
Above) The activity in the LFP represantation (same color code as above). The
activity appears as an alternating dipole, spread out from the ... strata
until well deep the mossy fibers.
Below) The same activity in CSD representation. The typical dipolar
structure is concentrated along the pyramidal strata and the finer details of other
poles are uncovered.
