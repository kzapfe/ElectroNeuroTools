Center of Mass and CSDA during epileptic outbursts in the Hippocampus of the Rat.

Rationale:
Epileptic activity on slices from the hippocampus of the rat is
induced to obtain high density data for the electrophysiological
recordings of action potentials on the soma layers.
The burst, with multiple population spikes,
does not occur homogeneously on the somatic strata, instead,
it propagates rapidly along the CA structures in a wave-like fashion.
A Current Source Density Analysis provides finer spatial
resolution from LFP data and could help us to understand the
important loci where the signal travels. A center-of-mass analysis would
record the trajectories of the vector-averaged signal.

Methods:

We have recorded the LFP of various slices of the hippocampus on
a 64 by 64 micro-electrode array (BioCAM 4096)  under the influence
of 4-Aminop.... This data was then cleaned of noise and the relevant numerical
operations performed on it in order to obtain the CSD. Then we developed
a method to follow the vector-averaged centers of disjoint components
of the CSD data. 

Results:

We could observe that the propagation of the activity of
epileptic burst on the hippocampus does not travel along a single
defined wave front, but that it splits into disjoint components and
they simultaneously run along various parts of the CA region. This could
point to a sort of "distributed signal analysis" inside the hippocampus
or could be a characteristic of epileptic activity.


Conclusions:

The epileptic activity occurs in the CA region in localized disjoint
components that propagate in wavelike fashion. The better spatial
resolution that provides the CSDA combined with a clear
distinction of disjoint sources and sinks permits us to follow
each of these coordinated groups. This paves the way for
comprehension of the details in which information travels and
is processed in the hippocampus.
