http://9gag.com/gag/apvg22bThe Disjoint Component Analysis in CSD representation.
A) The same instantaneous frames as on previous figures, showing the separation into the P, N, and ``thick zero'' sets. The features of the polar structure of firing neurons are exaggerated, and the disjoint structure of active units is evident along the CA structure.
B) The disjoint component decomposition of the P set for the middle frame of the above row. The most notorious components are label from 1 to 8.
C) The Center of Mass results for the previous decomposition. The Centers are indicated as black circles, with area proportional to the integrated intensity of the disjoint component.
D) The complete result for the same frame. The CM for the active areas are indicated as a small circle pointing their location and a transparent disk indicating their intensity. The surrounding noise has CM of one or two orders of magnitude below those present near the stratum pyramidale and can be discarded.
