 The CSD representation of the data from Figure 1. The data has been processed minimally, as described in the text. Only a Gaussian Spatial filter was used to reduce edge effects due to the sensibility of the Numerical Laplacian Operator.
A) The same three instantaneous frames as in Figure 1A, in CSD representation. In the middle frame the expected polar structure of firing neurons is clearly visible near the CA3-CA2 regions. The disjoint component analysis relies heavily on such structures.
B) The spatio-temporal representation along the same A-F line as in Figure 1. Near the electrode labeled D an alternating pole can be appreciated after the onset of the epileptic burst. Bilinear smoothing was applied to this colormap.
