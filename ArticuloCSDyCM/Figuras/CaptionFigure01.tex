The data obtained from the MEA BioCAM 4096 for a slice of rat's hippocampus during an epileptic burst induced with 4AP. A) Three samples of the electric potential obtained at three different moments: before, during and at the end of the epileptic burst. In the middle frame we present a sketch showing the approximate location of the CA and GD regions. In the last frame we indicate a cut along the CA apical-dendritical axis and selected electrodes. No interpolation or smoothing was used.
B) The electrophysiological traces of the selected electrodes and the heat map of the electric potential along the line A-F. The black lines correspond to the three previous frames presented in subfigure A.
