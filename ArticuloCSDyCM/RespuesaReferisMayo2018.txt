The CSDA was done following the next steps. First, discard
unusable channels, then smoothing the harder edges, and as last step
we apply  finite difference operator that gives the CSD.

Standard criteria for falling electrodes where used: if an electrode showed
less variance than  the  noise levels it was declared saturated and its signal
replaced with the average of its 8 neighbours. 
Afterwards, a Gaussian smoothing
filter  with a half-width of 42 micrometers was 
applied to reduce the effect of hard edges on the data.

We conducted bidimensional CSDA by convolution with the following operator:
(**poner la ecuación de la que se quejó M. de la P.  aquí **)
This operator is part of a family of convex finite difference operators that
reduce the cross effects of the rectangular grid. It is as close as possible
to a rotational invariant operator that performs better on this kind of 
rectangular ordered data (Lindenberg 1990). 


The CSD representation lends itself to separation of disjoint components,
as we can categorize the data in three sets: Sources, Sinks, and Neutral.
A connected component in this context would be a patch that can be trailed by paths
inside itself. The Sources or Sinks are sepparated by each other and by
the neutral set, so they are disjoint sets with various connected components. In order
to obtain the sepparation we defined a threshold value above the noise level
of the CSD signal and used the band defined above and below zero by this value
as the neutral set. This sepparates the signal into three sets: Sources, Neutral, and
Sinks. 
Then we applied to the Sources and Sinks set a single pass
algorithm to detect their disjoint  connected components (Vincent and Soille, 1991).
The vector average of each one of these components produces a Center of Mass,
that can be used to trace a putative displacemente of activity along
the tissue, and this in its turn can be used to obtain the instanteous velocity
of displacement (Zapfe et al 2015). All the code is written on the
open language Julia (Bezanson et al, 2017). Detailed and formal steps
are to be published
in a following paper, and the code is avaible and commented with examples  in a
Jupyter Notebook upon request (a complete version to be published as companion
to the following paper).


Sobre el punto 3)
===========================


Entre las lineas 271 y 288 de la versión de prueba tenemos que hacer unas
aclaraciones.

The instantaneous velocities of the Center of Mass can cover a range
of different phenomena, which can account for various modes
of transmission of activity. Our Center of Mass approach
is centered on short-distance effects,
namely ephactic and gap junctions, and even displacement
of action inside the cells themselves. Long axonal transmission is
outside the effects measured by this analysis, but other forms of
"displacement of activity" may be encounterd in this way.
