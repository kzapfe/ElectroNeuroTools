We conducted bidimensional CSDA by convolution with the following operator:
(poner ecuación aquí)
This operator is part of a family of convex finite difference operators that
reduce the cross effects of the rectangular grid. It is as close as possible
to a rotational invariant operator that can be used on this kind of 
rectangular ordered data (Lindenberg 1990). Furthermore, a Gaussian smoothing
filter  was 
applied to reduce the effect of hard edges on the data.

Standard criteria for falling electrodes where used: if an electrode showed
almost no variance in its recording, it was declared saturated and its signal
replaced with the average of its 8 neighbours. 

The CSD representation lends itself to separation of disjoint components. 
A connected set in this context would be a patch that can be trailed by paths
inside the set. The Sources or Sinks are sepparated by each other and by
the neutral set, so they are disjoint sets with connected components. In order
to obtain this sepparation we defined a threshold value above the noice level
of the CSD signal and used the band defined above and below zero by this value
as the neutral set. Then we applied to the Sources and Sinks set a single pass
algorithm to detect their  connected components (Vincent and Soille, 1991).
The vector average of each one of these components produces a Center of Mass,
that can be used to trace a putative displacemente of activity along
the tissue, and this in its turn can be used to obtain the instant velocity
of displacement (Zapfe et al 2015). All the code is written on the
open language Julia (Bezanson et al, 2017). Detailed steps are to be published
in a following paper, and the code is avaible and commented with examples  in a
Jupyter Notebook upon request.

===========================


Entre las lineas 271 y 288 de la versión de prueba tenemos que hacer unas
aclaraciones.

The instantaneus velocities of the Center of Mass can cover a range
of different phenomena, which can account for various modes
of transmission of activity, but it is centered on short-distance effects,
namely ephactic and gap junctions together, and also displacement
of action inside the cells themselves. Long axonal transmission is
outside this analysis.
